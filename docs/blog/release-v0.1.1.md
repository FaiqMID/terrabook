Very happy to announce this first stable release, here are a few things coming in this release:

- [Bugs & crash fixed](#bugs-%26-crash-fixed)
- [Some UI improvement](#some-ui-improvement)

## Complete boss section

Yeah, finally completing for each boss linked item pages with all the modes including Classic, Expert, and Master. I dropped some info which not relevant for the supported platforms (Desktop, Console & Mobile).

Since this is handcrafted from scratch (before it was using scrapper bot in old Terracraft app) then I still expect a mistake like typos or wrong placed items, so you help me by reporting it.

## Bugs & crash fixed

While on development I'm also encountering some bugs & from people's feedback, as I said before perhaps some bugs may still exist in this release, report it for hotfix release. :)

## Some UI improvement

More neat UI looks, smoother, and I hope a better experience.
