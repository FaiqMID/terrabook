## Why only show whitescreen?

Try to install **Android System Webview** in order to open Terrabook, sometimes people remove this in their custom modded Android OS (You usually cannot touch this with factory/unmodified OS) because they think it useless and want to free some storage space (I also doing this before, lol).

Why **Android System Webview** is needed? since Terrabook is web-based app then this is neccessary.
