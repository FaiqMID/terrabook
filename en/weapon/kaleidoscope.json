	"overview": [
		"The Kaleidoscope is a post-Plantera whip that has a 1/4 (25%) chance of being dropped by the Empress of Light boss.",

		"Like other whips, it causes minions to focus on the last-struck enemy and increases their damage against the target.",

		"Its best modifier is Legendary."
	],

	"notes": [
		"The Morning Star and Kaleidoscope have the unique ability to grant Minions the ability to deal critical hits. Though the boost is relatively low, it is nevertheless a noticeable increase in damage, especially with a large number of minions. The Kaleidoscope features the current highest summon tag critical chance at 10%."
	],

	"tips": [
		"Due to its high base damage, range, tag damage, and extra summon tag critical strike chance, it is the most powerful whip in the game.",
		[
			"However, the speed boost and dark energy from the Dark Harvest may be preferable in certain situations.",
			"The Firecracker can also outperform it against single targets, especially when used with the Stardust Dragon."
		],
		"The Kaleidoscope's large range and bright particles can make it useful for finding caves or exploring underground."
