	"overview": [
		"The Cutlass is a rare Hardmode sword that has a 0.5% (1 in 200) chance to be dropped by Pirate enemies in a Pirate Invasion. It has a higher chance to drop from Pirate Captains and the Flying Dutchman (2% and 10% respectively). The Cutlass deals good damage and can be swung continuously at very high speed.",

		"Its best modifier is Legendary."
	],

	"notes": [
		"Assuming the player never kills a Pirate Captain or Flying Dutchman, the odds of getting at least one Cutlass over the course of a Pirate Invasion are about 45%."
