	"overview": [
		"The Ghastly Glaive is a Hardmode spear which is dropped by the Ogre mini-boss during the Old One's Army event. Unlike most spears, the Ghastly Glaive wobbles when swung, causing its head to \"slash\" across a semi-randomized width. Upon striking an enemy, a yellow dragon-head ghost appears next to a random nearby enemy and flies in a straight line through it, damaging all enemies it passes through before vanishing after one second.",

		"Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."
	],

	"tips": [
		"Like other light-producing spears, the Ghastly Glaive is useful for finding ore deposits or other treasures underground by stabbing it into walls."
