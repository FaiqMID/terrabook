	"overview": [
		"The Candy Corn Rifle is a Hardmode post-Plantera gun that auto-fires Candy Corn as ammunition. It is dropped rarely (1.79â€“14.29% chance) by the Pumpking during the Pumpkin Moon event. Candy Corn drops along with the weapon, and can be purchased from the Arms Dealer when a Candy Corn Rifle is in the player's inventory.",

		"Candy Corn shots pierce up to two enemies and ricochet up to four times, dissipating on their fifth impact or third enemy hit. The gun has a high fire rate, but unlike most guns, its projectiles are affected by gravity and do not remain airborne for long, though their ricochet ability helps them gain distance.",

		"The Candy Corn Rifle has a base 10% critical strike chance as opposed to the usual 4%.",

		"Its best modifier is Unreal."
	],

	"tips": [
		"Its piercing ability may help on worm-type enemies, such as The Destroyer, and crowds of enemies. It is also a good weapon to use against the Frost Moon.",
    "It is especially useful on gun-only playthroughs. The second-best option, High Velocity Bullets, deal less damage to the second and third enemies hit on the Desktop version, and do not pierce enemies at all on the other versions."
