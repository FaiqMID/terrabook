	"overview": [
		"The Golem Fist is a Hardmode, post-Golem flail-type weapon that has a 1/7 (14.29%) chance of being dropped by the Golem. It fires a large fist attached to a chain that retracts on impact, similar to the one Golem uses. It fires forward at a rapid rate, similar to the KO Cannon and Harpoon. Firing at closer targets causes its fire rate to increase. The Golem Fist is one of the few flail-type weapons which contributes a gun-firing mechanism.",

		"It has the second highest knockback of all weapons, beaten only by the Slap Hand.",

		"The Golem Fist has a very short cool down period; therefore its auto-fire rate is dependent only on the distance to its impact, meaning that an enemy or object in close range will cause a faster autofire rate.",

		"Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."
	],

	"notes": [
		"Although technically a flail, the Golem Fist's projectile has no difficulty passing through terrain on its return trip."
