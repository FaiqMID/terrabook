	"overview": [
		"The Flower Pow is a Hardmode flail which is dropped by Plantera with a 1/7 (14.29%) chance. In addition to the usual flail mechanics, it has the unique ability to shoot petals toward enemies. It will launch the petals at a steady, rapid pace for as long as the fire button is held and there are unobstructed targets to shoot at. Dropping the flail head to the ground mid-throw will cause the fire rate of its petals to increase drastically. It is heavily affected by gravity, but holding the mouse can allow it to be held and dragged.",

		"Its best modifier is Godly or Demonic. Both modifiers increase the average damage output by the same amount."
	],

	"notes": [
		"When pressed against a 1 block wide wall, a player can launch their Flower Pow through the wall (this goes for every wall, above or beneath the player), making it helpful for attacking enemies from safety."
