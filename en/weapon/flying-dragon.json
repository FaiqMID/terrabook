	"overview": [
		"The Flying Dragon is a projectile sword which is dropped by Betsy during the Old One's Army event. It shoots crescent-shaped projectiles which travel through blocks and produce light. The projectiles can pierce through four enemies, dissipating after hitting the fifth enemy.",

		"On the Desktop version Desktop version, the projectile will deal half the damage (90) if the player does not have a direct line of sight on it.",

		"Its best modifier is Legendary."
	],

	"notes": [
    "The blade's hitbox extends considerably beyond the the blade sprite itself, barely beating out the Breaker Blade in horizontal range by about a pixel, but losing quite a bit in vertical range."
	],

	"tips": [
		"Due to its light-emitting, wall-piercing beams, this sword is useful for exploring and finding caves, behaving similarly to the Death Sickle.",
    "Aiming is slightly easier due to how wide the projectiles are, combining that with high melee speed, one can finish multi-segment bosses such as the Destroyer easily.",
    "It can be very useful for events due to its powerful attacks, projectiles, and crowd control capabilities.",
    "Its Hearty Slash is one of the most dangerous projectiles a Selenian can reflect, easily one-shotting characters even at full health."
