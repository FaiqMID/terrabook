	"overview": [
		"The Xenopopper is a Hardmode, post-Golem gun that uses bullets as ammunition, but fires a small initial cloud of four to five simultaneous \"bubbles\". The bubbles themselves do no damage and will bounce off solid blocks. They then pop after a short delay, firing bullets (one per bubble) that converge at the cursor's location. Each firing consumes only one bullet, but produces four to five projectiles each.",

		"The Xenopopper has a 1/6 (16.67%) chance to be dropped by the Martian Saucer during the Martian Madness event.",
		
		"Its best modifier is Unreal."
	],

	"notes": [
		"The Xenopopper fires an average of 4.25 bubbles per shot.[1] This means that, discounting modifiers, it will fire slightly over 12 bullets per second, which corresponds to an effective use time of 5. Furthermore, 76.5% of the fired bullets will not consume ammo. This makes it comparable to the Vortex Beater in overall stats."
	],

	"tips": [
		"The Xenopopper could be considered a variation of shotgun-type guns. In this case, its increased accuracy comes at the cost of a firing delay. This makes it perhaps more suited for single targets rather than area crowd control, depending on players' targeting skills.",
    "If attempting to control a large horde of enemies, rather than directly aiming one's mouse at the horde (and only hitting one or two enemies at a time), aim the mouse further away to increase chances of hitting more enemies.",
    "Bullets only aim themselves at the cursor's position once the bubbles pop. As a result, if the player fires behind themselves while moving away, the cursor may end up between the player and the bubbles before the bullets actually fire, effectively causing the shot to fire toward the player, and not the target. This can be negated by keeping the cursor as far away from the player as possible during movement.",
		["Using the Rifle Scope continuously can increase the distance between the player and the edge of the screen, making this strategy easier."],
    "The Xenopopper is useful during the Lunar Events as the Celestial Pillars are large and immobile, making them easy targets.",
    "If carefully aimed, the bubbles from the Xenopopper can be fired through 1-block wide walls, allowing this gun to be fired from cover. This requires the muzzle of the gun to be directly next to (but not in) the wall.",
    "Using Chlorophyte Bullets with the Xenopopper allows the player to take out groups of enemies quickly, because of the homing effect inherent to Chlorophyte Bullets."
