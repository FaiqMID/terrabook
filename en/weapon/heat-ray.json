	"overview": [
		"The Heat Ray is a Hardmode, post-Golem magic weapon that has a 1/7 (14.29%) chance to be dropped by Golem. It auto-fires beams which provide significant illumination and instantaneously strike their targets.",

		"On the Desktop version, Console version, and Mobile version, its beams do not pierce enemies, whereas on the Old-gen console version, 3DS version, Switch version, and tModLoader version, its beams can pierce an infinite number of enemies.",

		"Its best modifier is Mythical."
	],

	"notes": [
		"When wielding the Heat Ray, two fuel tanks will appear on the player's back.",

    ["[i:UI:Console_version] [i:UI:Mobile_version] The fuel tanks override the display of wings when not in flight. However, the display of the Hoverboard overrides the tanks."]
	],

	"tips": [
		"The instantaneous speed and perfect accuracy of the Heat Ray's beam makes it particularly effective for dealing with fast, distant, or flying enemies.",
    "The Heat Ray excels at outputting high damage to single targets, and, despite its lack of homing abilities, is a great weapon for dynamic and fast-moving bosses such as the Empress of Light.",
    ["While its quick fire rate also makes it a viable weapon for crowd control, the Staff of Earth (another Golem drop) is better suited for such a purpose."]
