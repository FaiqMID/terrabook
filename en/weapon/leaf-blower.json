	"overview": [
		"The Leaf Blower is a Hardmode magic weapon that fires a rapid barrage of leaf projectiles in a semi-random spread, which swerve slightly after about 15 tiles of travel. The leaves do not pierce enemies. The Leaf Blower has a 1/7 (14.29%) chance of being dropped by Plantera.",

		"Its best modifier is either Masterful for mana conservation or Godly/Demonic for higher damage output. It cannot get the Mythical modifier due to its low mana cost."
	],

	"notes": [
		"When wielding the weapon, a tank which appears to contain a small tree will appear on the player's back. If they have wings equipped, the wings will not be visible unless in use."
