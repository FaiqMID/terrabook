	"overview": [
		"The Brand of the Inferno is a Hardmode sword dropped by the Ogre mini-boss during the Old One's Army event.",

		"With any equipped shield (including the Squire's Shield, but not Huntress's Buckler) and holding this sword, right-clicking will cause the character to brace for the next attack (like Sergeant United Shield). When timed correctly, just before taking a hit, the enemy's attack will be parried, dealing some damage to the attacker and granting the Striking Moment buff for the next 5 seconds. This allows the next melee attack to deal 5x damage. Alternatively, if the shield is held in place, 20 defense is temporarily gained; this lasts until the shield is once again lowered.",

		"Its best modifier is Legendary."
	],

	"notes": [
		"[i:UI:Console version] [i:UI:Mobile version] The buff tooltip claims that damage is increased by 500% (i.e., multiplied by 6), which is incorrect.",
		"The Brand of the Inferno's damage reflection ability can only be used to deflect contact damage from enemies; fall damage, lava damage, enemy projectiles and traps will still harm the player.",
		["It can however reduce damage from many sources with the 20 defense gained while right-clicking."],
		"The act of gaining the attack buff and switching to a more powerful weapon like Meowmere has potential for massive damage, especially if somehow timed perfectly with the Psycho Knife's buffs.",
		"Parrying in Journey Mode with the God Mode power enabled will do nothing."
