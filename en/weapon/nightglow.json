	"overview": [
		"The Nightglow is a Hardmode, post-Plantera magic weapon that has a 1/4 (25%) chance to be dropped by the Empress of Light. When fired, four rainbow crystals emerge from the player and home in on nearby enemies.",

		"Each of the rainbow crystals can pierce enemies and hit three times, resulting in high potential damage, but loses 20% of damage for each enemy struck.[1] However, since they spawn in random directions from the player and are destroyed if they collide with obstacles, it can be difficult to use this weapon in confined spaces.",

		"Its best modifier is Mythical."
	],

	"notes": [
		"The weapon is visibly held by the player when selected, and provides light."
