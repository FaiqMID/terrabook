	"overview": [
		"The Tome of Infinite Wisdom is a Hardmode magic weapon which is dropped by Ogre mini-boss during the Old One's Army event. When fired, it auto-fires four high-velocity pages that do not pierce. <kbd>âš· Open / Activate</kbd> summons a tornado which can pierce enemies, travels through one-block low roofs, lasts four seconds, and will be stopped by a wall. If used while moving on a flying mount, its pages spread out.",

		"Its best modifier is Mythical."
	],

	"tips": [
		"The right-click attack's whirlwind is great for clearing out plants and thorns in the Evil Biomes and Jungle. This can help with flower collection or finding Life Fruit.",
    "Although it uses a lot of mana, the Tome is able to do a lot of damage in small bursts with quick projectiles, making it useful for the Hardmode Jungle's high-health enemies. It is useful even against bosses.",
    "The standard attack is great for single enemies, while the tornado attack is good for multiple targets.",
    "This weapon can defeat The Destroyer with ease even in Master Mode, making it a viable weapon choice, however requires at least one of the Mechanical bosses be defeated."
