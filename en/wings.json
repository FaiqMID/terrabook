	"overview": [
		"Wings are Hardmode (with the single exception of Fledgling Wings) accessories that allow the player to fly temporarily by pressing and holding the <kbd>↷ Jump</kbd> key. Flight time is reset when the player rests on solid objects, including both standing on blocks and using climbing items like Ropes, Hooks, Shoe Spikes, and Climbing Claws. Certain wing types also allow the player to hover at fixed heights by holding the <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> key during flight, and/or accelerate their ascent speed by holding the <kbd>▲ Up</kbd> key.",

		"After flight time has been exhausted, a player can continue holding the <kbd>↷ Jump</kbd> key to glide. Gliding fall speed can be accelerated by holding the <kbd>▼ Down</kbd> key in addition.",

		"Wings additionally grant immunity from fall damage (except when overridden by the Stoned debuff), rendering fall damage protection items like the Lucky Horseshoe unnecessary.",

		"Flight is much more controlled with wings than with Rocket Boots, Spectre Boots, etc. alone, and they allow for much greater flight range. Equipping wings generally replaces jumps entirely with flight, rather than requiring a double-jump to activate. Double-jump accessories like the Cloud in a Bottle will still grant an additional jump, which is used after all flight time.",

		"There are currently 47 unique wing types in total: 45 are available on Desktop version, Console version, and Mobile version, 39 on Switch version and tModLoader version, and 21 on Old-gen console version and 3DS version. Flight time and speed can vary by the version."
	],

	"types": [
		"Wings have a variety of origins: Some can be crafted, a few can be purchased outright, one is an Angler reward, a few are dropped directly from bosses, and one is gifted to every new Journey Mode character or found in chests and crates.",

		"In Expert Mode, more wings can come as part of Treasure Bags: Each Hardmode Treasure Bag has a 1/20 (5%) chance to drop a random set of developer items, and all sets include wings (with the exception of Aaron's set).",

		"Most craftable wings are crafted at a Hardmode Anvil: Each requires 20 Souls of Flight plus a \"key\" item determining the wing type. This key can be a rare enemy drop with no other use, or a quantity of material representing a new stage of the game.",

		"The four lunar wings (Solar Wings, Vortex Booster, Nebula Mantle, and Stardust Wings) are instead crafted like other endgame equipment: At the Ancient Manipulator from Luminite Bars and Lunar Fragments; they do not require Souls of Flight.",

		"All wings can be sold for 8 Gold Coins, except for the Leaf Wings (15 Gold Coins) and Steampunk Wings (60 Gold Coins)."
