		"The Hive Wand places Hives as blocks, which otherwise cannot be placed. Hives must be in the player's inventory in order to place them. It has a 1/3 (33.33%) chance to be dropped by Queen Bee.",

		"Mining a Hive block placed with the Hive Wand is the same as mining a naturally generated one, hence it can spawn Bees or honey."
