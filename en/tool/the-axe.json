	"overview": [
		"The Axe is a Hardmode, post-Plantera hamaxe, a combination of a hammer and an axe. It produces an overdriven electric guitar sound when swung, which changes in tone depending on the distance from the cursor to the player. The Axe has a 1/50 (2%) chance of being dropped by Plantera.",

		"Its best modifier is Legendary. While Light may seem to provide a better speed boost by percentages, rounding reveals that Legendary and Light mine at equal speeds for this tool."
	],

	"notes": [
		"The Axe is capable of breaking Demon and Crimson Altars.",
    "In PvP, it seems to be able to hit a player twice in one swing.",
    "While autoswinging, the player will be unable to change direction.",
    "It has the highest axe power of any item in the game (175%), even surpassing that of the Luminite Hamaxes (all 150%). It also has 12 more base damage, but its range is shorter by 3 tiles.",
    "Despite the lower axe power, the Luminite Hamaxes are recommended for building as they have a higher tile reach than The Axe."
