	"overview": [
		"Hooks are a class of tools which aid the player in traversing terrain. When used, hooks fire a chain that latches to a surface or platform and pulls the player towards it. A hook is an essential tool which offers significant freedom from terrain height restrictions as well as being a fast movement option, and will often be the first major mobility tool a player acquires. A variety of hooks are available at all stages of the game (see table below).",

		"The <kbd>Grapple</kbd> hotkey activates the equipped hook in the player's equipment slot, or the first hook from the inventory (read from left→right, top→bottom) without requiring it to be in the player's hotbar.",

		"Several higher-tier hooks, like the Ivy Whip, allow the player to grapple multiple surfaces simultaneously. If the character grapples one surface, then fires the hook a second time, another chain extends from the player without dislodging the first. Upon grappling a second surface, the player will be suspended in midair at a point midway between the two surfaces. This allows players more freedom during construction, or for navigating hazardous areas, such as above lava or Meteorite.",

		"All Journey Mode characters will spawn with the basic Grappling Hook already in their inventory.",

		"When the player first acquires a hook, a small tutorial box will pop up telling the player how to use it."
	],

	"types": [
		"Hooks vary in range, velocity, number of deployable hooks, and number of hooks that can remain latched simultaneously.",

		"All crafted hooks are crafted at the Iron Anvil or Lead Anvil, with the exception of the Lunar Hook, crafted at the Ancient Manipulator.",
		
		"Single hooks dislodge immediately if fired again while already latched to a surface.",

		"Multi-hooks without simultaneous latching (Dual Hook; also the Fish Hook prior to 1.3) can fire a second chain before the first latches to a surface, but will dislodge the first chain when the second latches a surface.",

		"A multi-hook can be fired again only after the previous chain latched a surface or fully retracted. The Fish Hook, Dual Hook, Web Slinger, and Lunar Hook are exceptions, and can be fired very rapidly; nearly as fast as the player can press the button."
