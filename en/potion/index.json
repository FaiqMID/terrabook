		"Potions are a group of consumable items that either recover health and/or mana instantaneously or over time or grant temporary buffs or debuffs. Potions are commonly found in natural chests and Pots and can be dropped by enemies, purchased from NPCs, or crafted. Most potions can be crafted at a Placed Bottle or Alchemy Table, but flasks must be crafted at an Imbuing Station.",

		"Potion buffs can be canceled at any time by right-clicking the buff icon (Desktop version), by selecting the buff icon and canceling it in the equipment menu (Switch version Old-gen console version), by selecting the buff with Left Shoulder Button + X/B then canceling the buff with A (Console version), by double-tapping the buff icon (Mobile version), or by canceling the buff from the buffs screen (3DS version). All potion buffs (including food buffs) are lost when dying, or when saving and reloading the world.",

		"In Journey mode, all Potions require 20 to unlock duplication, but 30 are needed for recovery potions."
