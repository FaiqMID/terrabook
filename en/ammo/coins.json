	"overview": [
		"Coins are the main unit of currency in Terraria. They are primarily used for NPC transactions, but can also be used as ammunition for the Coin Gun. Terraria's economy is quadrimetallic, meaning currency is made of four different metals making four types of coins: Copper Coins, Silver Coins, Gold Coins, and Platinum Coins.",

		"Coins can be obtained by killing enemies, interacting with NPCs, or finding them in multiple forms of loot. Despite coins appearing as the materials \"Copper\", \"Silver\", \"Gold\", or \"Platinum\", they are not related to their respective ore types and cannot be crafted from them.",
		
		"The coin value an enemy drops upon death is calculated from fixed values in the game code, with some random variation. See NPC drops ยง Coin drops for further information."
	],

	"notes": [
		"Coins have their damage values (from a Coin Gun) listed, and are listed as ammo.",
		"Coin Portals have a rare chance to be opened by Pots.",
		"In addition to the coins most slimes already drop, coins have a small chance to appear as a bonus drop.",
		"Silver Coin Piles can sometimes be found in the Underground and Caverns in a Campsite, often accompanied by a Campfire and a background object of skeletal remains and in a Pyramid."
	],

	"tips": [
		"Coins can be researched in Journey Mode. Although tedious, players can duplicate 100 copper and work their way up the denominations until they reach 100 platinum.",
		"A sure way to achieve this is to research Gold or Platinum bars, then sell them in stacks of 999."
