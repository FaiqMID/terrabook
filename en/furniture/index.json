	"overview": [
		"Furniture is a class of items that can be placed on blocks, or hung from them, usually to become background objects that characters can move over and through. Some are functional, such as crafting stations, Chests, Beds, mechanisms, and light sources (among others), while many are mainly decorative. Most furniture items are sorted into sets. Furniture is acquired through crafting, by collecting furniture items that appear naturally in the world, dropped by Pirates, or purchasing from NPCs. Most placed furniture can be freed with a pickaxe.",
		"Although primarily decorative, when placed, the Pink Vase, Mug, and various cups also serve as a Placed Bottle crafting station.",
		"Items that must be hung from \"ceiling\" blocks (the underside of blocks) cannot be hung from platforms, unless said platform is hammered into its lowered position.",
		"Lava will dislodge most placed furniture, with the exception of pumps, statues, and Obsidian Furniture found in the Ruined Houses of the Underworld.",
		"Although furniture can not be actuated in-game, if done through the use of external Map viewers that have world editing feature, they still work, i.e. beds can still be slept in."
