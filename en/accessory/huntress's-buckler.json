	"overview": [
		"The Huntress's Buckler is a Hardmode shield accessory that increases the player's maximum number of sentries by one and increases summon damage by 10%. It is dropped by the Ogre during the Old One's Army event with a 8.33% / [e=12.5%] (T2) or 4.17% (T3) chance."
	],

	"notes": [
		"Despite the tooltip implying that the accessory boosts the damage of minions only, it also affects sentries and whips.",
    "Neither of its bonuses stack with the Apprentice's Scarf, Monk's Belt, or Squire's Shield.",
    "Unlike most other shield accessories, the Huntress's Buckler does not synergize with the Brand of the Inferno to block attacks."
