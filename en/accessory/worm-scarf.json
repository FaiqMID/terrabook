	"overview": [
		"The Worm Scarf is an Expert Mode accessory that reduces incoming damage by 17%. The Worm Scarf is always obtained from the Eater of Worlds' Treasure Bag.",

		"This damage reduction from this item is calculated after defense is applied:",

		"Damage_taken = ( Raw_damage - (Defense * (.5 or .75 or 1 for normal/expert/master modes respectively)) ) * (1 - .17)",

		"Visually, it appears to be piercing through the playerâ€™s shoulder."
	],

	"notes": [
		"Beetle armor at its 45% state, Worm Scarf (17%) and Endurance Potion (10%) will reduce damage by nearly 60%.",
    ["(100%-45%) * (100%-(17%+10%)) = 40.15% damage taken = 59.85% damage reduction"],
    "Frozen Turtle Shell (25%) will further increase it to almost 74%.",
    ["(100%-45%) * (100%-(25%+17%+10%)) = 26.4% damage taken = 73.6% damage reduction"]
	],

	"tips": [
		"Percent damage reduction on accessories/potions apply first, then damage reduction on set bonuses are applied (e.g. Beetle armor, Solar Flare armor).",
    "When fighting the Dungeon Guardian, the Worm Scarf (when combined with a few potions or accessories) can allow the player to survive a hit from the Dungeon Guardian without the use of too many accessories and buffs.",
    "As the game progresses, enemies will start hitting well into the 300-400 damage range. The Worm Scarf thus becomes valuable in reducing damage and making massive hits tolerable.",
    "Since the Worm Scarf can be taken into non-expert worlds, it is often a good idea to level a character up to near or post-Hardmode gear, create an Expert world, and easily defeat the Eater of Worlds for its Worm Scarf, which remains useful even at endgame."
