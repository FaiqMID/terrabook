	"overview": [
		"The Hive Pack is an Expert Mode accessory found in the Treasure Bag dropped by the Queen Bee.",
		"When equipped, half of all friendly bees created by the caster will appear as larger, more damaging versions. As opposed to a normal bee's potential 1 bonus damage, these more damaging bees can deal up to 1-4 extra damage, and fly noticeably faster. Stronger bees also deal 0.5 knockback (with a 1.1Ã— multiplier), can pierce 3 enemies (instead of normal bees' 2), and last 11 seconds instead of 10. Note that since all sources of strong bees have 0 knockback, the multiplier is never effective.",
		"It also allows the Bee Gun, Bee Keeper, Honey Comb and its derivative accessories an extra 33% chance to summon an additional bee when used."
	],

	"notes": [
		"The Wasp Gun does not receive any benefits from the Hive Pack. This is probably because it fires wasps, not bees, as its name suggests.",
    "The Hornet Staff does not receive any benefits from the Hive Pack. This is probably because it summons hornets, not bees, as its name suggests."
