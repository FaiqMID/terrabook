	"overview": [
		"The Squire's Shield is a Hardmode shield accessory that increases the player's maximum number of sentries by one and increases summon damage by 10%. It is dropped by the Ogre during the Old One's Army event with an 8.33% / [e=12.5%] (T2) or 4.17% (T3) chance."
	],

	"notes": [
		"Despite the tooltip implying that the accessory boosts the damage of minions only, it also affects sentries and whips.",
    "Neither of its bonuses stack with the Apprentice's Scarf, Huntress's Buckler, or Monk's Belt.",
    "Like most other shields, the Squire's Shield synergizes with the Brand of the Inferno to block an attack."
