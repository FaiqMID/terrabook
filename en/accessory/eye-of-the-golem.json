		"The Eye of the Golem is a Hardmode, post-Golem accessory that grants +10% critical strike chance. It has a 1/7 (14.29%) chance of being dropped by the Golem."
	],

	"tips": [
		"This accessory is helpful when fighting the Dungeon Guardian, as critical strikes deal more damage.",
    "The accessory is also helpful when making AFK boss farms.",
    "The critical hit chance of the Eye of the Golem can be combined with the Destroyer Emblem to get a total of 18% increased critical hit chance. This can be further increased to 26% if both accessories have the Lucky modifier.",
    "By using other damage increasing accessories along with this one, like emblems and quivers, the player can massively increase their damage output."
