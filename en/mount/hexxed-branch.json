{
	"overview": [
		"The Hexxed Branch is a mount-summoning item which summons a rideable Tree Mount. It is dropped by the Mourning Wood in Master Mode with a 1/4 (25%) chance. The Tree Mount is a ground-based mount; it is unable to fly. While travelling at full speed, enemies in its path will be hit by 120 base summon damage."
	],

	"notes": [
		"The top running speed of the Tree Mount is 82 mph, reached after 0.533 seconds. Its maximum diagonal speed is 96 mph, achieved by jumping off a ledge at full speed."
	],

	"tips": [
		"The Tree Mount's acceleration is extraordinarily high. It achieves high speed very quickly without a dash (e.g. Tabi or Shield of Cthulhu) and can allow one to make sharp turns midair if it is summoned while falling, making it rather useful for boss fights."
