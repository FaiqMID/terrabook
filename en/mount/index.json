	"overview": [
		"Mounts are creatures or objects that act as vehicles that a player can use for transportation or dealing damage. When a mount-summoning item is used, it applies an unlimited buff to the player, spawns the mount, and places the player on or in it. Mount movement can be controlled using the player's usual movement keys. Like pets and minions, mounts can be used limitlessly, and their summoning items are not consumed. Only one mount can be in effect at a time. Mounts will unequip automatically when the player dies.",
		
		"Weapons and tools (as well as any other item, except hooks) can be used while riding a mount, except for the Drill Mount.",

		"All mount items can be placed in the mount slot and then summoned with <kbd>Quick Mount</kbd>, and can be dyed. Equipping a mount provides a short burst of light (except Bee and Scutlix).",

		"There are currently 26 mounts, each with varying abilities and movement statistics. All mount-summoning items have the [rarity:8] rarity, except for the Shrimpy Truffle and Witch's Broom, which have the [rarity:rainbow] rarity, and Master Mode-exclusive mounts, which have the [rarity:fiery_red] rarity.",

		"All mounts that do damage (e.g Slime Mount) will do Summon damage.",

		"Mount-summoning items do not have modifiers and therefore cannot be reforged."
