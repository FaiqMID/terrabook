	"overview": [
		"Relics are furniture items dropped by bosses in Master Mode. They are golden depictions of their respective boss that hover above a pedestal, have a golden particle effect, and emit light when placed close to a light source.",

		"There are currently 27 different relics available in Terraria."
	],

	"notes": [
		"Relics are purely vanity, and have no effect on the bosses they are dropped from.",
    "All relics are referred to as \"Master Trophies\" in their internal names.",
    "The Skeletron, Skeletron Prime, Lunatic Cultist, and Ogre Relics all appear to be off-center due to the relic base having an odd number of pixels and the relic itself having an even number.",
    "The fluorescent behavior can be observed when placing a Torch near an unlit relic, such as during the night.",
    "Like Stone and Mud, relics must be painted with Deep Paint in order to show any noticeable color.",
    "When painted, only the base is affected by the paint, the small statue of the boss is not."
