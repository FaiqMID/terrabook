	"overview": [
		"Masks are vanity items dropped by all non-event bosses, except those from the Old One's Army. They are worn in the social head slot. Each boss has a 1/7 (14.29%) chance to drop its own mask."
	],
	"notes": [
		"The Lunatic Cultist Mask is arguably the most tedious to obtain, not because it is hard to defeat the Lunatic Cultist, but because it is impossible to farm him without spawning in and completing the Lunar Events likely multiple times.",

		"After updating to a Desktop version 1.3-equivalent, the Ocram Mask became unobtainable on Console version.",
		
		[
			"Any Ocram Mask already existing in character inventories or worlds was converted into Lunatic Cultist Mask in 1.4",
			"It is impossible to obtain on the Switch version, as Ocram was never available on this version."
		],

		"Three of the masks have animations: The King Slime, Queen Slime, and Moon Lord Masks will move around when the player moves left or right."
