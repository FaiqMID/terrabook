	"overview": [
		"The Suspicious Grinning Eye is a Master Mode-exclusive drop from the Eye of Cthulhu, with a 1/4 (25%) chance to drop. It summons a Suspicious Eye pet which resembles the Eye of Cthulhu. It normally shows a blue iris and pupil, but when moving at above certain speed the pupil slides up and reveals a mouth, similar to the Eye of Cthulhu's second form."
