	"overview": [
		"The Jewel of Light is a Master Mode-exclusive light pet-summoning item that has a 25*1/4 (25%) chance to be dropped by the Empress of Light. When used, it will summon a pet Fairy Princess that provides pink-colored light. It is fast and will always position itself slightly elevated behind the player."
	],

	"notes": [
		"Despite being exclusive to Master Mode, the fairy does not possess any unique abilities, such as the Wisp in a Bottle's manual repositioning or the Suspicious Looking Tentacle's treasure sensing. This, combined with the fact that it still has the same brightness as those items (120%) might render its usefulness rather limited.",
		[
			"However, one might prefer the fairy for its lighting color and static positioning behind the player's back."
