		"The Eye Bone is a pet-summoning item which has a 1/3 (33%) chance to drop from the Deerclops.",

		"When used, it will summon a mobile Piggy Bank named Chester, a reference to the Don't Starve series. Chester is essentially an upgrade to the Money Trough, because it does not need to be re-summoned every time the player wants to use their piggy bank."
