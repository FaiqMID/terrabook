	"overview": [
		"The Creeper Egg is a Hardmode summoning item that gives the player a Flickerwick light pet. It is dropped by the Ogre during the Old One's Army event. When active, it is similar to the Wisp in a Bottle, where it provides light where ever you go. The summoned Flickerwick has the same movement speed as the player, and cannot be left behind easily."
