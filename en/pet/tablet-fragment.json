		"The Tablet Fragment is a pet summon item with a 1/4 (25%) chance to drop from the Lunatic Cultist in Master Mode. It summons a Phantasmal Dragon pet that follows the player. It resembles the Phantasm Dragon spawned during the Lunatic Cultist boss fight. The only difference between the two is that the pet itself is smaller."
